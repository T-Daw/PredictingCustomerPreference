# CustomerBrandPreference
Predict which Brand of Products Customers Prefer

The sales team engaged a market research firm to conduct a survey of our existing customers. One of the objectives of the survey was to find out which of two brands of computers our customers prefer. This information will help us decide with which manufacturer we should pursue a deeper strategic relationship. Unfortunately, the answer to the brand preference question was not properly captured for all of the respondents.

That is where you come in: I want you to investigate if customer responses to some survey questions (e.g. income, age, etc.) enable us to predict the answer to the brand preference question. If we can do this with confidence, I would like you to make those predictions and provide the sales team with a complete view of what brand our customers prefer.

To do this, I would like you to run and optimize at least two different decision tree classification methods in R - C5.0 and RandomForest - and compare which one works better for this data set. 

I have already set up the data for you in the attached CSV files: the file labelled CompleteResponses.csv is the data set you will use to train your model and build your predictive model. It includes ~10,000 fully-answered surveys and the key to the survey can be found in survey_key.csv. The file labelled SurveyIncomplete.csv will be your main test set (the data you will apply your optimized model to predict the brand preference). You'll be applying your trained and tested model to this data to prepare the model for production.

When you have completed your analysis, please submit a brief report that includes the methods you tried and your results.

Thanks,
Danielle
