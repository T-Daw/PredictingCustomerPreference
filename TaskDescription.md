# Predicting Customer Preferences

Blackwell Electronics is a successful consumer electronics retailer with both bricks & mortar stores in the southeastern United States and an eCommerce site. They have recently begun to leverage the data collected from online and in-store transactions to gain insight into their customers' purchasing behavior. My job is to extend their application of data mining methods to develop predictive models through  R and Python. I will use machine learning methods to predict which brand of computer products Blackwell customers prefer based on customer demographics collected from a marketing survey, and then I will go on to determine associations between products that will be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives such as recommender systems like the ones used by Amazon and other eCommerce sites. Finally, I will present to management, explaining my insights and suggestions for data mining process improvements.
